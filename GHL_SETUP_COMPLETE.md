## 📋 How It Works

### When a User Submits the Form:

1. **User fills out the pre-screening form** on your landing page
2. **Form submits to** `/api/submit-lead`
3. **API creates contact in GoHighLevel** with:
   - Name (properly capitalized)
   - Phone (E.164 format: +1...)
   - Email (lowercase, trimmed)
   - Location (city, state, postal code from IP)
   - Tags: `website-lead`, `Lp(a)`, `qualified`
   - Source: "Pre-Screening Form - Website"

4. **Two notes are added to the contact:**
   - Qualification Status
   - Full Assessment with all answers

5. **Parallel backups** (non-blocking):
   - Google Sheets
   - CRIO integration

6. **User sees success message** and gets booking link

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Leads not showing up in GoHighLevel?

1. **Run the test**: `npm run ghl:test`
2. **Check API key**: Verify in `.env` file
3. **Check Location ID**: Should be `QIjU06ElWLhQKKXOVKZT`
4. **Check GHL dashboard**: Look for test leads

### Common Error Messages:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY in .env |
| 403 Forbidden | Missing permissions | Verify API key has contact permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Wrong Location ID | Verify GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID |
| Network Error | Connection issue | Check internet or GHL status |

### Development Mode:

In development, the form will work even if GHL integration fails. This allows you to develop and test without breaking the form experience.
