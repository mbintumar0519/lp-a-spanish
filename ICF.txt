This form is for use in a research study that may involve participants who may or may not have the capacity to consent to take part in the study.  When the participant cannot legally consent to take part, pronouns “you” and “your” should be read as referring to the participant rather than the person (legally authorized representative) who is signing this form for the participant. In cases where the participant’s representative gives consent, the participant should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. During the course of the study, if the participant regains the capacity to consent, informed consent will be obtained from the participant and the participant offered the ability to leave the study if desired.
KEY STUDY INFORMATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION
You are invited to take part in the main research study; the details are provided in this main screening informed consent form.
This form gives you important information about this main research study to help you decide if you want to take part in it.  If you decide to take part, you will be asked to sign and date this form.  You will also be given a copy of the signed form.
Please take the time to read this information carefully. The study doctor  will explain the details of this main research study to you and you can ask questions.  You can also discuss the study with other people like your family or personal doctor.  The contact information for the study team is listed on the first page of this form.  You also will be given a card with important emergency contact information.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THIS STUDY AND ITS PURPOSE
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) occurs when there is cholesterol or other fatty build-up (plaques) on the walls of the blood vessels (arteries).  Severe buildup of these plaques can block blood flow and increase the risk of serious heart or blood vessel disease events such as heart attacks, strokes, or other blood vessel blockages.  ASCVD Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease and smoking history.  Lipoprotein(a) (also known as Lp “little a” and Lp(a)) is a sticky particle that carries cholesterol in the blood.  High levels of Lp(a) can increase the chance of plaques building up in the arteries.
This main research study is being done to learn more about olpasiran (also known as AMG 890) in people with elevated Lp[a], and risk factors for ASCVD and/or evidence of cholesterol plaques in the arteries.  If you have elevated Lp(a) levels and risk factors for ASCVD and/or evidence of atherosclerosis, this means you may have a higher risk for new heart or blood vessel disease events.
The study is being done primarily to:  
	•	See if olpasiran reduces the risk of having a cardiovascular event such as heart attack, an urgent procedure to improve blood flow through the coronary (heart) vessel or death due to heart disease.
	•	Understand if olpasiran causes any side effects and how well it is tolerated.
If you join the study, you will take either olpasiran every 12 weeks (Q12W) or placebo (inactive substance) every 12 weeks as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously).  Olpasiran and placebo will be called the study drug.
This study does not replace your regular medical care.  If you need medical care during the study, contact your personal doctor and tell the study team. If you have a different personal doctor, the study doctor will tell your personal doctor that you are taking part in this study. 
You can choose not to take part in this study; you are free to say yes or no.  Your options may include:

	•	Continuing your current treatment regimen.
	•	Taking part in a different research study. 
If you do not wish to take part, the study doctor will discuss other options with you.  You may stop the study at any time for any reason without any change to your regular medical care or penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  If you decide to stop taking part in this study, you must tell the study doctor.  The study team will explain what other procedures or discussions may be needed.
It is not known if this study can help you. In the study, you may feel better or worse or stay the same.  The information from this study might help find more treatments in the future for cardiovascular disease.
When new important information is learned about the study, your study doctor will tell you so you can decide if you would like to stay on the study.  When this happens, you may be asked to read and sign this form again.
PARTICIPATION INFORMATION FOR THIS STUDY
If you decide to take part in the study, an evaluation that includes a review of your health history and lab tests will be done to Get your Lp(a) Tested.  If you do not qualify, you may not be able to start the study, and the study doctor will discuss other options with you 
If you qualify and agree to take part, you are expected to be in this study for 3.5 to 5.5 years, based on when you start taking part and how long it takes for the study to gather the required information.  The study includes:
	•	A screening period, up to approximately 2 months, 
	•	A study treatment period, approximately 42-63 months,
	•	A safety follow-up period of about 30 ( 7) days after the last dose of study drug.
If more safety-related data is needed to follow rules and guidelines from regulatory agencies (like the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) then more information may need to be taken from your records after you end the study.
About 11000 participants from approximately 900 global study centers will take part in this study.
STUDY DRUG INFORMATION
Olpasiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule that blocks the production of Lp(a).  All participants who take part in this study will get olpasiran or placebo.
Olpasiran will be compared with placebo.  The placebo will look like olpasiran but it will not contain active ingredients.  A placebo has no medical effect but looks like olpasiran.
You will be assigned, by chance, into 1 of 2 groups, like flipping a coin.  
You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group, olpasiran or placebo.  
Neither you, the study doctor, nor the study staff will know which study treatment you are receiving.  In an emergency, the study doctor can find out what you are receiving.
You will be required to fast (not eat or drink except water) for at least 9 hours before some laboratory tests during the study.  Study drug will be administered as a subcutaneous injection (injection given just under the skin - this means that a short needle will be used to inject the study drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle) in your arm, front of thigh, or abdomen (stomach) about every 3 months (every 12 weeks).  For the first 3 scheduled dosing visits, you will be asked to stay at the study site for observation for at least 30 minutes after you receive the study drug.  The study drug will never be given within less than 4 weeks of a previous dose.
Olpasiran is being developed by Amgen Inc., a for-profit biopharmaceutical company.  Olpasiran is still an experimental drug, which means that it is being tested and is not approved by any regulatory health agency (e.g., the United States [US] Food and Drug Administration [FDA], Therapeutic Goods of Australia [TGA], or European Medicines Agency [EMA]).
OVERVIEW OF STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS
You will have to come to the study site for approximately 16 to 28 visits.  Over these visits, you will be examined by the study doctor, get a minimum of 17 subcutaneous injections (injection given just under the skin), and have your blood collected.  Each time you give blood; the site staff will take about 20-40mL (2-3 tablespoons).  
If you complete the entire study, the total amount of blood collected from you will be about 360 mL (24 tablespoons).  These procedures monitor how your body responds to the study drug and in some cases help decide if you should continue on the study drug.  More blood may be taken if extra tests are needed for your health and safety.
A biomarker is something in your blood or tissue that can be used to measure the status of your disease and/or the effects of the study drug on your body. Samples will be collected from you and used for biomarker testing as part of this study.

c Blood collection includes tests for complete blood count, coagulation, routine chemistry.
d The pharmacokinetics blood samples on day 1 and W48 will be collected at any time between 1 and 72 hours post-dose.  Fasting is not required.
e If not obtained per schedule collect sample at your next scheduled visit.
f  Participant questionnaires will be collected in (Canada, France, Germany, and UK only).
g After study drug administration on day 1, W12, and W24 visits, you will be asked to stay at the study site for observation for at least 30 minutes before leaving the study site.

Demographics:  The study doctor and/or their study staff will collect information about your sex (the physical differences that help assign someone male, female, or intersex at birth), age (in years, based on birth month at time of visit), race, and ethnicity (depending on the country you live in).
Medical History:  The study doctor and/or their study staff will ask you for your medical history (including medical, and surgical history as well as any medications that you are taking).
Physical Measurement, Physical Examination and Vital Signs:  The study doctor and/or their study staff will also perform a routine physical examination.  The study doctor will also take your waist circumference, height, and weight.  Height and weight will be measured at screening, and vital signs (take your blood pressure, heart rate [or pulse, how many times your heart beats per minute]) at specified times as listed in Table 2.
Blood Tests:  You will have your blood taken during the study. Possible side effects of having blood taken include tenderness, pain, bruising, bleeding, and/or infection where the needle goes into the skin and vein. Having your blood taken may also cause you to feel nauseous or light-headed. You should abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood collection.
Electrocardiogram (ECG):  An ECG is a recording of the normal electrical activity of your heart and is taken by placing electrodes (adhesive tabs attached to wires) on the skin of your chest, arms, and legs. Occasionally there may be some minor skin irritation from the electrodes.
Pregnancy Test:  Pregnancy tests for females will be performed through a blood or urine sample if you are assigned female at birth and are of childbearing ability.
Urine Tests:  Urine tests will be performed to measure your general health.
Fasting:  For laboratory visits, when required, you will need to fast (not eating or drinking anything) for at least 9 hours before the visit.  Possible side effects of fasting are that you may feel weak, hungry, sweaty, nervous, or restless.
Antibodies:  If you start taking olpasiran, it is possible that your body may make antibodies that may stop olpasiran from working or may cause side effects.  Blood tests will be used to check for these antibodies during the study.  If there are safety related concerns, follow up antibody testing may be needed for longer and/or more often. 
Review of Heart Treatments/Serious Health Events:  This will be performed by discussion with your study doctor at scheduled visits.  If for any reason you are unable to attend your scheduled visit and the study doctor or site staff cannot contact you during the study, they may try to contact authorized alternative contacts or search publicly available records.  This could also include your primary care physician if you have given permission for them to be contacted.
WHEN YOU STOP TAKING PART IN THE STUDY AND HOW YOUR SAMPLES WILL BE HANDLED
What happens when you discontinue study drug or stop taking part in the study
The study doctor or Amgen may stop you from taking study drug or taking part in this study at any time.  The study doctor will tell you if this happens.  Some reasons this could happen include:
You need treatment not allowed by the study.
You are not able to complete the study procedures that are needed.
Staying in the study could harm you.
You become pregnant.
The whole study or part of it is stopped by Amgen because of something that does not have anything to do with you.
There may be other reasons to stop you from taking part in this study that no one knows right now.  
When you stop taking part in this study, all information and samples collected from you before you stopped may still be used by Amgen, companies that work for/with Amgen, regulatory agencies, or external review bodies to learn more about olpasiran and/or cardiovascular disease, or how the olpasiran works in the body, or for internal purposes other than this study, as allowed by law.
You may choose to stop taking study drug or stop taking part in the study at any time, by informing your study doctor.  If you want to stop taking study drug, you will still be asked to come back for some additional tests and procedures.  The study doctor will discuss the following options with you:
You can stop taking the study drug(s) but keep doing all other study tests and procedures. 
If you don’t wish to continue to attend study visits, the study team will discuss with you other ways to follow-up such as by phone, through your medical doctor, or by reviewing your medical records.  You can also choose to have no more contact with the study team.  
If you stop taking part in the study, or the study ends early, you will stop getting the study drug(s).
It is very important for the study and science that Amgen has the most correct information, even if you decide to leave the study.  For this reason, the study doctor may use public records and/or public sources of information and/or a third-party vendor to collect health-related information until the study ends, as allowed by law.
If you stop taking part in the study but do not tell the study team, your information will keep being used and you may be contacted to check if you still want to take part in the study.  If the study doctor or site staff cannot contact you during the study, they may try to contact your authorized alternative contacts, your primary care physician or search publicly available sources. If you agree to this, please inform your alternative contacts about this possibility. If you cannot be located, an independent third-party company may be used to assist the study doctor and site staff in making searches using public sources (including appropriate public registries) in order to locate you or collect information regarding your vital status. 
Your name, address, date of birth and phone number may be shared with the independent third-party company, but they will not, at any time, contact you and will not use or disclose information about you for any other purpose or to anyone else other than your study doctor or site staff. If the study site cannot reach you and if it is allowed by law, Amgen may use records about your health that are available to the general public.
What happens to your samples
Amgen and companies working for/with Amgen will use your samples (e.g., blood) for tests listed in this form, for tests needed to be sure you are safe, or for additional tests that may be required by health authorities.
All of your samples will be labeled with a special code (“encoded").  Only the study doctor and the study staff will be able to link your samples to you.  
All information that comes from your samples will be kept confidential (secret) as stated in the CONFIDENTIALITY section of this form.
Your samples will be destroyed after all study-related analyses and the study report are done. Any data already collected from those samples will still be used for the study. Biomarker development sample (as listed in Table 2), will be stored until the associated analysis is complete, up to a maximum of 20 years.
As part of this study, you have the option to allow Amgen to store any samples remaining from the assessments listed in Table 2, and from the Lp(a) screen sample you agreed to take part in under the Lp(a) Screen Consent for use in future research into atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and to learn more about olpasiran, how olpasiran works in the body and better ways to measure Lp(a).  There will be no additional procedures required, however, you will need to sign an additional consent form to confirm that Amgen can store any remaining samples for up to 20 years after you have finished the study. 
You can also choose to allow your samples to be used for optional genetic research (more details on future research and optional genetic research are provided in the optional consent section). 
POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
Likely risks with olpasiran
After you start taking part in this study, you should tell the study team immediately if you have any health problems, injuries, or side effects, even if you do not think these problems are caused by the study or the study drug or the prefilled syringe.  
Olpasiran may cause all, some, or none of the side effects listed below.  These side effects can be mild but can also be serious, life-threatening, or even result in death.  You may also have other side effects or an allergic reaction that has not been seen before. You should not operate hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until you are reasonably certain that olpasiran does not affect you adversely.
As of 23 June 2024, about 4033 adult participants have taken olpasiran at least 1 time in research studies. 
Side effects that other people have had that are thought to have been caused by olpasiran are:
Injection site reactions
In completed studies, injection site reactions (like redness, pain, bruising, swelling, or other skin reaction at the area of skin where study drug is given) have been commonly reported (between 1 and 10 people in every 100) with olpasiran.
	•	You may or may not experience reactions at the site where the study drug is injected.  
	•	Injection site reactions can occur anytime but were generally observed or reported within the first 48 hours of injection with olpasiran.  Most reactions resolved within 48 hours without any need for treatment.  Some reactions were treated with ointment (a cream that is put on the skin), in order to soothe/treat it.  
Serious Allergic Reaction
Serious allergic reactions may occur, with symptoms like all over skin rash, itching, redness or itchy raised red bumps/welts on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty to swallow, feeling queasy/feeling like you need to throw up, vomiting, sweating, increase or decrease in heart rate, and low blood pressure that may be severe or life-threatening.  Symptoms can happen within minutes or hours after receiving study drug.  You can have a serious allergic reaction even though you’ve received other doses before, without any side effects.  If you think you may be having a reaction, seek medical attention immediately. 
You must tell the study doctor / study staff if you have any known allergies.
Possible effect(s) of very low Lp(a)
Olpasiran works to lower Lp(a).  Type 2 diabetes is a disease where blood glucose (a form of sugar) is too high.  Some large studies show a link between very low Lp(a) and developing type 2 diabetes.  However, some studies do not show this link.  During the study, you will have your blood sugar monitored.
Side effects that have been reported with other drugs that work in a similar way to olpasiran (but are used to treat other health conditions):
It is not known whether these side effects may affect you when you take olpasiran.  All side effects should be reported to your study doctor / study staff.
These side effects can be mild, but in some cases, may be serious, life-threatening, or even result in death. 
	•	Allergic reactions that are not at the injection site
Allergic reactions with symptoms that include 1 or more of the following: skin rash, itching or redness that may occur in a small area of skin or over a larger area and that is seen along with another symptom such as chills, cough, shortness of breath, feeling queasy/feeling like you need to throw up, vomiting, sweating, and an increase or decrease in heart rate which may also include low blood pressure that in some cases, may be severe or life-threatening. 
	•	Immune system reaction (the body’s defense against infections)
	•	Your body can make proteins, which may stop the study drug from working or may cause side effects.  These proteins are called antibodies.  It is not known whether these antibodies will harm you in any way. 
	•	Flu like symptoms, such as headache, muscular, joint, or back pain, tiredness, chills, and runny nose.
	•	Liver and kidney function abnormalities
Changes in one or more of the tests that measure how well the liver and kidneys are working.  An abnormal test result doesn’t always mean that your liver or kidneys aren’t working properly. 
	•	Nervous system
Damage to nerves that causes weakness, numbness, or sensations such as prickling, tickling, tingling, and pain in the arms, hands, legs, and/or feet, which may or may not get better over time. 

	•	Decreased platelets
Platelets are part of the blood that help clotting (stop bleeding).  If platelets are too low, there is a risk of bleeding.  Decreased platelets may be temporary and may or may not recover after stopping the study drug.
	•	Increased blood clotting time 
If your blood takes longer than normal to clot, you may be at greater risk of bleeding.
	•	Muscle injury 
Injury to muscles that may cause pain, weakness, stiffness, or cramps.
The study doctor will monitor your health through physical exams and blood tests.  If a blood test becomes abnormal, a symptom appears, or if your study doctor suspects a problem, the study doctor may request additional tests or a specialist to examine you.  Also, you will be followed up until symptoms resolve and/or tests return to levels considered safe by your study doctor.
If you are assigned to olpasiran and start taking it, it is possible that your body may make proteins (antibodies) that may stop olpasiran from working or may cause side effects. 
Risks of using olpasiran in combination with other drugs
Tell the study doctor or the study staff about any drugs you are taking, have recently taken, or are planning to take, including herbal remedies, supplements, and drugs you take without a prescription.  The side effects of using olpasiran in combination with other drugs are unknown at this time.  Please discuss any concerns you may have with the study doctor.
Risks of taking the other drugs required by this study
If you have elevated cholesterol, in particular elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in addition to elevated Lp(a), you may be required to take medication to lower cholesterol.  The study doctor will talk with you about the risks of taking these drugs.
Risks associated with the pre-filled syringe used to give study drug during the study
If you agree to participate in this study, the study doctor or staff will use a prefilled syringe to inject either olpasiran or placebo into the tissue below your skin. 
When using the prefilled syringe, you may go through all, some, or none of the following:
Pain or discomfort at the injection site during or after the injection
Bleeding, bruising, redness, warmth, itching, swelling, or firmness of the skin at the injection site
Infection at the injection site
Risks associated with the Lp(a) test (Tina-quant Lp(a) RxDx Assay) used during this study
The use of the diagnostic test to measure Lp(a) in this study is experimental which means that it has not been approved or certified for use with olpasiran by any regulatory agency (like the FDA) or independent reviewing body for the way it will be used in this study.
Therefore, there is a risk that the Lp(a) test used in this study may produce incorrect results.  It is possible an incorrect result will show that you meet the conditions the study is looking for when you otherwise would not have.  If this happens and you participate in the study, then you could be exposed to the study drug’s side effects without possibly really needing it.  The other possibility is that the diagnostic test may show that you do not meet the conditions the study is looking for when you otherwise would have.    
PREGNANCY
It is not known if olpasiran is harmful to an unborn or breastfed baby.
Pregnant participants, breastfeeding participants, and participants planning to become pregnant or donate eggs should not take part in this study.
If you or your partner becomes pregnant during the study and until 30 days after the last dose of study drug, tell the study doctor right away.
If you or your partner become pregnant during this study, potential risks could include the loss of the pregnancy or birth defects. 
If you become pregnant, breastfeed, or you get your partner pregnant while you are taking the study drug, and until 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the study doctor will collect information about the pregnancy and its outcome for up to 12 months after birth. 
If you are a participant who is able to get pregnant, you will have a pregnancy test to check that you are not pregnant before you can begin the study drug.
BIRTH CONTROL INFORMATION
If you or your partner want to stop your birth control during the study, tell the study doctor right away as you will have to stop taking part in the study.
Female Participants:
If you are unable to become pregnant for one of the following reasons, the use of birth control methods is not required during this study:
	•	Your doctor has confirmed that you are postmenopausal.
	•	You have had your uterus, or both ovaries, or both fallopian tubes removed.
If you could become pregnant, you:
	•	Should let your sexual partner know you are in this study.
	•	Must agree to practice true sexual abstinence (not have sex) or you must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during the study and for an additional 30 days after your last dose of study drug.
	•	Must discuss your pregnancy prevention method with the study doctor to ensure it is acceptable.  You should be aware that true sexual abstinence is the only 100 effective birth control method.
Acceptable methods of effective birth control for female participants include:
	•	Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal methods (pills, vaginal ring, or skin patch).
	•	Single hormonal methods (progestogen) to stop release of the egg from the ovary (pills, shots/injections, implants [placed under the skin by a healthcare provider]).
	•	Intrauterine (inside the uterus) device (IUD).
	•	Intrauterine (inside the uterus) hormonal-releasing system (IUS).
	•	Surgery to tie both fallopian tubes (bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion).
	•	Your male partner has had a vasectomy (a surgical procedure to permanently prevent pregnancy by cutting or sealing the tubes that carry a man's sperm) and testing shows there is no sperm in the semen.
	•	Not having sex.
	•	Male or female condom with or without spermicide (chemicals to stop sperm from getting to an egg).
	•	Cap, diaphragm (a circular dome made of soft, thin silicone that is inserted into the vagina before sex), or sponge with spermicide.
	•	Double barrier method: the male uses a condom and the female may choose either a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom).
If you decide to participate in this study, you must agree to not become pregnant or not to breastfeed.  If you think you are pregnant or accidentally become pregnant or breastfeed during the study and for an additional 30 days after stopping the study drug, you must tell the study doctor or study staff right away.  The study drug may be stopped.  The study doctor will notify Amgen of the pregnancy or that you are breastfeeding.  You will be asked to provide information on the pregnancy or breastfeeding outcome for you and the baby for up to 12 months after birth.
Male Participants:
Male participants are not required to use birth control during the study.  However, you should let your female partner know that you are in this study.
Please notify the study doctor if you father a child while you are taking the study drug and within 30 days after stopping the study drug.  Further information may be asked of you.  The study doctor will ask your partner to collect information about the pregnancy and its outcome for up to 12 months after birth.
COMPENSATION FOR INJURY
If you become ill or are injured while you are in the study, get the medical care that you need right away. You should inform the healthcare professional treating you that you are participating in this study. If you tell the study team that you think you have been injured then they will help you get the care you need. 
If you have an injury or illness directly related to the correctly given study drug or study procedures that were done correctly and only from participating in the study, Amgen will pay you back reasonable medical costs for its treatment. You will not be paid or paid back for treatment covered by a third party (including insurance provider co-payments or deductibles for this treatment) or for things like lost wages, pain and suffering, or costs other than medical care. By signing this document, you will not lose any of your legal rights or release anyone involved in the research from responsibility for mistakes.
To pay medical expenses, the sponsor will need to know some information about you like your name, date of birth, and Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI). This is because the sponsor has to check to see if you receive Medicare and if you do, report the payment it makes to Medicare.
POTENTIAL COSTS/REIMBURSEMENTS
You will not have any extra costs if you take part in this study.  You will get study drug olpasiran at no charge, and there will be no charges for the visits, tests, or procedures that are part of this study.  You will need to pay for all costs not related to the study like the normal treatment of your medical conditions.
Some of the medical care that you will get in this study is regular health care that you should have even if you were not in the study.  The cost of this care will not be paid by Amgen, including insurance provider co-payments, deductibles and other out of pocket costs.  You can ask the study doctor for more information about this cost.
A Fixed Fee reimbursement of $100.00 will be paid for each study visit to cover inconvenience.
You will be paid following each completed visit.
You will be paid back for reasonable out-of-pocket costs including e.g., travel, parking from taking part in this study. You will be reimbursed after you submit your travel receipts to the study staff.  
If you do not complete the study, for any reason, you will be paid for each study visit you do complete. 
If you have any questions regarding your compensation for participation, please contact the study team.  
Amgen will not pay you if any product is developed through the use of your samples or medical information collected during the study.  Amgen, other researchers, or other research companies may patent or sell discoveries. You do not have any rights to future inventions.
CONFIDENTIALITY 
To be part of the study, you will need to allow Amgen to use your information.  When the word “information” is used, it means your personal information, like (but not limited to) your medical information, study results, and medical images (like X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).  Amgen will not share it with the public.
What information is collected about you during the study
Information that can be used to identify you, like your name, address, telephone number, email address, and year of birth.  This information is not shared with Amgen on purpose.
Sensitive personal information, like your medical history, sex, data from this study, HIV status, race, and ethnicity.
Data from testing and analysis of biological samples and images, like results of blood or urine tests and MRIs, computed tomography (CT) scans, and X-rays.
Data captured from electronic devices, like information from questionnaires.
Who will use your information at the study site, how will they use it, and where it will be stored
The information collected during this study will be kept at your study site.  It may be sent to secure systems so that Amgen and/or companies that work for/with Amgen can see it and use it for the study. 
Your information might be shared with 4 groups if needed by law for 1) doing the study, 2) making sure the study is done the right way, 3) getting approval of the study drug from the government and, 4) if it is approved, for selling the study drug, including:
Government or regulatory authorities.
External review bodies (like Institutional Review Board(s) [IRB]) that make sure the study is being done the right way
People or organizations who work for, on behalf of, or with Amgen (like auditors and monitors)
Any company or organization that has rights to develop and/or sell the study drug
What happens to your information and samples when they are sent outside the study site
Your participation in this study will be noted in your medical records.  If your personal doctor is different from the study doctor, they may also be notified.
Your information and samples will not show your name.  Information about you taking part in the study will be linked to you by using a participant identification number (it will be “encoded”).  Only the study doctor and team will be able to link that number to who you are.  If results of the study are published, no one will know who you are or that you took part in the study. 
Information about you will be collected, sent, used, and handled in an encoded form (both by computer and manually) by Amgen, the companies that work for/with Amgen (like central laboratories), the study doctor and the study team, and others involved in the study like regulatory authorities and external review bodies.  
Amgen, companies that work for/with Amgen, regulatory agencies, and external review bodies, may use data from this study, for scientific reasons other than the study.  This information may be used (but is not limited to) to see how the study drug works and how safe it is; find new ways to use the study drug to treat disease; learn more about the disease(s) or condition(s) that are being studied; planning for future studies with other study drugs; and how Amgen can do things better.
Regulatory agencies (like the FDA) and biopharmaceutical companies (like Amgen) believe that sharing study data improves science and medicine and is best for patients and public health.  Because of this, your information may be anonymized to learn from, or shared with other researchers or research companies that are independent from Amgen, including for purposes different from this study.  Anonymization is different than encoding and means that your information will be changed in a way that cannot be re-linked back to you like encoding can. 
If your information is sent by Amgen to other countries, Amgen will take steps to make sure the information is kept secret and is sent the way it needs to be by law. While every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of your information, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)
A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.

This law generally will protect you in the following ways:

	•	Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that the sponsor will get from this research.
	•	Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.
	•	Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that the sponsor will get from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.

All health insurance companies and group health plans and all employers with 15 or more people must follow this law.

Be aware that this Federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance or long-term care insurance.
Your data protection rights and who to contact about them
If you have any questions about your rights to your personal information or want to correct, delete, or get a copy of the personal information about you, please tell the study doctor.  You cannot be given information about which study drug you are receiving and/or results from study procedures while the study is being done. 
If you do not have a study site data privacy contact, you may contact Amgen’s Data Protection Officer at privacy@amgen.com.  You can also send a complaint to your local data privacy authority.

OPTIONAL PART(S) OF THIS STUDY
Future Research
 Use of Samples for Future Research
You can take part in extra research in addition to the main study already described.  Any samples left over from the tests in the Tests and Procedures table (Table 2) including blood and biomarker samples may be used for future research by Amgen and the companies working for/with Amgen.  These samples can be used to learn more about cardiovascular disease, how olpasiran works, and/or the way olpasiran acts on the body, and how to best measure Lp(a) in human samples.
You do not have to agree to this extra research.  You can choose to take part only in the main study.  If you say no to this extra research, your samples will be destroyed once all study-defined analysis is done.
These samples may be stored for up to 20 years after all the participants have finished the study.  Amgen and the companies that work for/with Amgen will make sure your samples are destroyed at the end of this time.  You may tell the study doctor at any time that you do not want your samples to be used for this future research.  If you ask for this, your samples will be destroyed once all study-defined analysis is done, and no new testing will be started.  Any information collected from your samples before you asked for them to be destroyed will be kept by Amgen.
If you decide to stop taking part in the study, your study doctor will ask if you want to have your samples kept for future research.  
Based on your decision, Amgen and companies that work for/with Amgen may still use your samples for future research until the end of the storage period.
You will not directly benefit from taking part in this study or change how your disease is treated.  Because of this, the results will not be sent to you, members of your family, the study doctor, your personal doctor or other third parties, unless it says in the  CONFIDENTIALITY section of this form.
Consent to Use Samples for Future Research
By signing below, you agree that Amgen can use and store your samples remaining from the tests listed in the Tests and Procedures table including blood and biomarker development samples for future research in cardiovascular disease conditions, or how olpasiran works on the body.
   Yes, I agree my samples can be used for future research.
   No, I do not want my samples used for future research.

Genetic Research
You can take part in extra genetic research in addition to the main study already described.  Genetic research looks at your inherited genetic material (DNA) in your blood cells.  Inherited genetic material is passed down from parent to child.  Lp(a) is a highly atherogenic (tends to promote the formation of fatty plaques in the arteries) lipoprotein that is under strong genetic control (expression of genes).  Differences in inherited genetic material can affect the way a disease develops, the way drugs act on the body, or the way your body uses drugs.  This genetic research will be done to learn more about cardiovascular disease or how the olpasiran works.  Any blood samples left over from the tests done by Amgen and companies working for/with Amgen in the main study may be used for genetic research.
No additional samples will be collected for this research.  Your samples will be kept as described in this form.
You will not directly benefit from taking part in this study or change how your disease is treated.  Because of this, the results will not be sent to you, members of your family, the study doctor, your personal doctor, or other third parties, unless it says in the  CONFIDENTIALITY section of this form.
